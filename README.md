History

About 3,500 years ago, a game board like those used for this game was found carved into a roofing slab of the temple at Al-Qurna in Egypt. This game is also known as Achi, Kwasiada frankaa among the natives of Ghana, West Africa. The game appeared in one of the many games publications by R. C. Bell in the middle of the twentieth century. He reported that it was still played in Ghana at the time. Ghanaian school children would mark the board out on the ground, and use sticks as pieces; one player's sticks would have the bark stripped off to distinguish them from the opponent.
